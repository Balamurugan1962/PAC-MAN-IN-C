# PAC-MAN-IN-C
# PACMAN Game Application

## Project Description

This project is a PACMAN Game Application developed as part of the UCS2265 - Fundamentals and Practice of Software Development course at Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering (Autonomous), Kalavakkam. The game allows the user to control PACMAN, a hungry yellow character, navigating through a maze, gobbling up pellets while avoiding ghosts. The objective is for PACMAN to consume all the pellets scattered throughout the maze without being captured by ghosts.

## Features

- PACMAN can move through the maze, one tile at a time.
- Keyboard controls are used to control PACMAN's movement.
- The maze contains walls that PACMAN cannot pass through.
- The maze is filled with regular pellets and power pellets.
- Consuming a regular pellet earns one point, while a power pellet earns five points.
- After consuming five power pellets, PACMAN can consume a ghost, earning a substantial number of points.
- PACMAN starts the game with three lives and loses a life each time a ghost touches it.
- Obtaining more than 5,000 points earns the player an extra life.
- PACMAN can have a maximum of three lives.
- Ghosts attempt to catch PACMAN while PACMAN tries to consume all the pellets.
- Ghosts do not collide with each other.
- Ghosts update their paths based on PACMAN's movement and vice versa.
